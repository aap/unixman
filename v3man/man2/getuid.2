DESCRIPTION	getuid______ returns
the real user ID of
the current process.
The real user ID identifies the person who is logged in,
in contradistinction to the effective user ID, which
determines his access permission at each moment.
It is thus useful to programs which operate using
the "set user ID" mode, to find out who invoked them.
