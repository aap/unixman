DESCRIPTION	sync____
causes the super block for all file systems to be written out.
It is only necessary on systems in which
this writing may be delayed
for a long time, i.e., those which
incorporate hardware protection facilities.

It should be used by programs which examine a file system,
for example check, df, tm, etc.
