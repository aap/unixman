NAME		intr  --  set interrupt handling
.sp
.ti 0
SYNOPSIS	sys intr; arg  / intr = 27.
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	When arg___ is 0,
interrupts (ASCII DELETE) are ignored.
When arg___ is 1,
interrupts cause their normal result, that is, force an exit____.
When arg___ is a location within the program, control is
transferred to that location when an interrupt occurs.
.sp
After an interrupt is caught, it is possible to resume
execution by means of an rti___ instruction; however, great
care must be exercised, since
all I/O is terminated abruptly upon an interrupt.
In particular, reads of the typewriter tend to return
with 0 characters read, thus simulating an end of file.
