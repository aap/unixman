NAME		creat  --  create a new file

SYNOPSIS	sys	creat; name; mode	/ creat = 8.
.br
(file descriptor in r0)
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	creat_____
creates a new file or prepares to rewrite an existing
file called name____;
name____ is the address of a null-terminated string.
If the file did not exist, it is given mode mode____;
if it did exist, its mode and owner remain unchanged
but it is truncated to 0 length.
.sp
The file is also opened for writing, and its file descriptor
is returned in r0.
.sp
The mode____ given is arbitrary; it need not allow
writing.
This feature is used by programs which deal with temporary
files of fixed names.  The creation is done with
a mode that forbids writing.  Then if a second
instance of the program attempts a creat_____, an error is
returned and the program knows that the name is unusable
for the moment.

DIAGNOSTICS	The error bit
(c-bit) may be set if: a needed directory is not readable;
the file does not exist and the directory
in which it is to be created is not writable; the file
does exist and is unwritable;
the file is a directory;
there are already 10 files open.
