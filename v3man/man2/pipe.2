NAME		pipe -- create a pipe
.sp
.ti 0
SYNOPSIS	sys pipe	/ pipe = 42.; not in assembler
.br
(file descriptor in r0)
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	The
pipe____
system call
creates an I/O mechanism called a pipe.
The file descriptor returned can
be used in both read and write operations.
When the pipe is written,
the data is buffered up to 504 bytes
at which time the writing process is suspended.
A read on the pipe will pick up the buffered data.
.sp
It is assumed that after the
pipe____ has been set up,
two (or more)
cooperating processes
(created by subsequent fork____ calls)
will pass data through the
pipe with read____ and write_____ calls.

The shell has a syntax
to set up a linear array of processes
connected by pipes.
.sp
Read calls on an empty
pipe (no buffered data) with only one end
(no synonymous file
descriptors resulting from fork____ or dup___)
return an end-of-file.
Write calls under similar conditions are ignored.
