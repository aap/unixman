DESCRIPTION	fork____
is the only way new processes are created.
The new process's core image is a copy of
that of the caller of fork____; the only distinction
is the return location and the fact
that r0 in the old process contains the process ID
of the new process.
This process ID is used by wait____.

DIAGNOSTICS	The error bit
(c-bit) is set in the old process if a new process
could not be created because of lack of process space.
