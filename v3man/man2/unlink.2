DESCRIPTION	Name____
points to a null-terminated string.

from its directory.

the contents of the file are freed and the file is destroyed.
If, however, the file was open in any process, the actual
destruction is delayed until it is closed, even though
the directory entry has disappeared.

(except for the super-user).
