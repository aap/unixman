NAME		rele  --  release processor
.sp
.ti 0
SYNOPSIS	sys rele  / rele = 0;  not in assembler
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	This call
causes the process to be swapped out immediately if
another process wants to run.
Its main reason for being is internal
to the system, namely to implement timer-runout swaps.
However, it can be used beneficially by programs
which wish to loop for some reason without
consuming more processor time than necessary.
