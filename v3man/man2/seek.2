NAME		seek  --  move read/write pointer
.sp
.ti 0
SYNOPSIS	(file descriptor in r0)
.br
sys seek; offset; ptrname  / seek = 19.
.a
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	The file
descriptor refers to a file open for reading or writing.
The read (resp. write) pointer for the file is set as follows:
.in +3
.sp
if ptrname_______ is 0, the pointer is set to offset______.
.sp
if ptrname_______
is 1, the pointer is set to its current location plus offset______.
.sp
if ptrname_______ is 2, the pointer is set to the size of the
file plus offset______.
.sp
.in -3
.sp
.ti 0
SEE ALSO	--
.sp
.ti 0
DIAGNOSTICS	The error bit
(c-bit) is set for an undefined file descriptor.
.sp
.ti 0
BUGS		A file
can conceptually be as large
as 2**20 bytes.
Clearly only 2**16 bytes can be addressed by
seek____.
The problem is most acute on the
large special files.
