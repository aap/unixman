DESCRIPTION	msh___
is a heavily simplified version of the Shell.
It reads one line from the standard
input file, interprets it as a command, and calls the command.

The mini-shell supports few of the advanced features
of the Shell; none of the following characters is special:

   > < $ \\ ; &

However, "*", "[", and "?" are recognized and glob____ is called.
The main use of msh___ is to provide a command-executing
facility for various interactive sub-systems.
