NAME		dpd -- spawn data phone daemon

SYNOPSIS	/etc/dpd________
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	dpd___
is the 201 data phone daemon.
It is designed to submit jobs to
the Honeywell 6070 computer via the gerts
interface.
.sp
dpd___ uses the directory /usr/dpd________.
The file lock____ in that directory is used
to prevent two daemons from becoming active.
After the daemon has successfully set the lock,
it forks and the main path exits, thus
spawning the daemon.
/usr/dpd________ is scanned for any file
beginning with df__.
Each such file is submitted as a job.
Each line of a job file must begin with a key
character to specify what to do with the remainder
of the line
.sp
.in +3
S_ directs dpd to generate a unique snumb card.
This card is generated by incrementing the first
word of the file /usr/dpd/snumb______________
and converting that to decimal concatenated with
the station ID.
.sp
L_ specifies that the remainder of the line is to
be sent as a literal.
.sp
B_ specifies that the rest of the line
is a file name. That file is to
be sent as binary cards.
.sp
F_ is the same as B_ except a form feed is prepended to the file.
.sp
U_ specifies that the rest of the line
is a file name.
After the job has been transmitted,
the file is unlinked.
.sp
.in -3
Any error encountered will cause the daemon to
drop the call, wait up to 20 minutes and start over.
This means that an improperly constructed
df__ file may cause the same job to be submitted
every 20 minutes.
.sp
While waiting, the
daemon checks to
see that the lock____ file still exists.
If the lock____ is gone, the
daemon will exit.
