NAME		sort -- sort a file
.sp
.ti 0
SYNOPSIS	sort____ [ -_ ] [ input [ output ] ]
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	sort____
will sort the input file and write the
sorted file on the output file.
If the output file is not given,
the input file is rewritten.
If the input file is missing,
sort uses the standard input as
input and the standard output for output.
Thus sort____ may be used as a filter.

The sort is line-by-line in increasing ASCII collating sequence,
except that upper-case letters are considered
the same as the lower-case letters.

The optional argument -_ will cause a reverse sort.

sort____ is implemented in such a way that

	sort /dev/mt0

works correctly provided the tape is not too big.
