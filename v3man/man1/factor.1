SYNOPSIS	factor______
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	When factor is invoked, it types
out "Enter:" at you.  If you type in a positive
number less than 2^56 (about 7.2E16), it will repeat the number
back at you and then its prime factors each one printed
the proper number of times.  Then it says "Enter:" again.
To exit, feed it an EOT or a delete.
.sp
Maximum time to factor is proportional to sqrt(n) and occurs
when n is prime.  It takes 1 minute to factor a prime near 10^13.
