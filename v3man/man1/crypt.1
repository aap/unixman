SYNOPSIS	crypt_____ [ password ]
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	crypt_____
is an exact implementation of Boris Hagelin's
cryptographic machine called the M-209 by the U. S. Army [1].

crypt_____ reads from the standard input file and writes
on the standard output.
For a given password, the encryption
process is idempotent;
that is,

	crypt znorkle <clear >cypher
	crypt znorkle <cypher

will print the clear.

crypt_____ is suitable
for use as a filter:

	pr <"crypt bandersnatch"<cypher
