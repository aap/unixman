SYNOPSIS	forml_____ [ name ] ...

DESCRIPTION	A streamlined program for typing form letters.
The names pick out
prestored form letters prepared according to the conventions
of
.ul
form
and
.ul
roff.
The program prompts to get each blank
filled in.
When all the forms are completed, it prompts "Set paper."
It waits for a newline before printing each letter.

If more than one name is given, the name of 
each letter is announced
before the prompts for it begin.
If no names are given, the program asks "Which letter?" before
each.
Respond with the name and a newline, or newline only when done.
.sp
On a 2741 type terminal, the program assumes the
letter is to be typed with a correspondence ball,
and also prompts "Change ball."
Replace the ball at the end.
