NAME		goto  --  command transfer

.ti 0
SYNOPSIS	goto____ label
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	goto____
is only allowed when the Shell
is taking commands from a file.
The file is searched (from the beginning)
for a line beginning with ":" followed by one
or more spaces followed by
the label_____.
If such a line is found, the goto____ command returns.
Since the read pointer in the command file points to the
line after the label,
the effect is to cause the Shell to transfer to the
labelled line.

":" is a do-nothing
command that only serves to place a label.
