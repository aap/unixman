SYNOPSIS	ar__ key afile name918 ...
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	ar__
maintains groups of files
combined into a single archive file.
Its main use
is to create and update library files as used by the loader.
It can be used, though, for any similar purpose.
.sp
key___ is one character from the set drtux_____,
optionally concatenated with v_.
afile_____ is the archive file.
The names_____ are constituent files in the archive file.
The meanings of the key___ characters are:
.sp
d_ means delete the named files from the archive file.
.sp
r_ means replace the named files in the archive file.
If the archive file does not exist, r_ will create it.
If the named files are not in the archive file, they are appended.
.sp
t_ prints a table of contents of the archive file.
If no names are given, all files in the archive are tabled.
If names are given, only those files are tabled.
.sp
u_ is similar to r_ except that only those
files that have been modified are replaced.
If no names are given, all files in the archive that
have been modified will be replaced by the modified version.
.sp
x_ will extract the named files.
If no names are given, all files in the archive are
extracted.
In neither case does x_ alter the archive file.
.sp
v_ means verbose.
Under the verbose option,
ar__ gives a file-by-file
description of the making of a
new archive file from the old archive and the constituent files.
The following abbreviations
are used:
.sp
   c_ copy
   a_ append
   d_ delete
   r_ replace
   x_ extract

BUGS		Option
vt__ should be implemented as a table with more information.
.sp
There should be a way to specify the placement
of a new file in an archive.
Currently, it is placed at the end.

"ar x" changes the modified-date of the current
directory to a random number.
