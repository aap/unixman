DESCRIPTION	mail____
without an argument searches for a file called mailbox_______, prints
it if present, and asks if it should be saved.  If the answer
is "y", the mail is renamed mbox____, otherwise it is deleted.
Mail____ with a -yn___ argument works the same way, except
that the answer to the question is supplied by the argument.
.sp
When followed by the names of a letter
and one or more people,
the letter is appended to
each person's mailbox_______.
When a person______ is specified without a letter______,
the letter is taken from the sender's standard input up to an EOT.
Each letter is preceded by the sender's name and a postmark.

A person______ is either
a user name recognized by login_____, in which case the mail
is sent to the default working directory of that user,
or the path name of a directory,
in which case mailbox_______ in that directory is used.
.sp
When a user logs in he is informed of the presence
of mail.
