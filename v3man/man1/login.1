NAME		login  --  sign onto UNIX

SYNOPSIS	login_____  [ username [ password ] ]
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	The login_____ command
is used when a user initially
signs onto UNIX, or it may be used at any time to change
from one user to another.
The latter case is the one summarized above and
described here.
See login_____ (VII) for how to dial up initially.

If login_____ is invoked without an argument,
it will ask for a user name, and, if
appropriate, a password.
Echoing is turned off (if possible) during the typing of the password,
so it will not appear on the written record of the
session.
.sp
After a successful login,
accounting files are updated and
the user is informed of the
existence of mailbox
and message-of-the-day files.

Login is recognized by the Shell
and executed directly (without forking).
