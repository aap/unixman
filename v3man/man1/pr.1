DESCRIPTION	pr__
produces a printed listing of one or more files.
The output is separated into pages headed by a date,
the name of the file or a header (if any), and the page number.
If there are no file arguments, pr__ prints the standard
input file, and is thus usable as a filter.

Options apply to all following files but may be reset
between files:

   -c__ print current date
   -m__ print date file last modified (default)
.sp
   -_n produce n-column output
.sp

.sp
   -h__ treats the next argument as a header

If there is a header in force, it is printed in place of
the file name.
