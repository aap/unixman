NAME		tss -- interface to Honeywell TSS
.sp
.ti 0
SYNOPSIS	tss___
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	tss___
will call the Honeywell 6070 on
the 201 data phone.
It will then go into direct access with
TSS.
Output generated by TSS is typed on the standard output and
input requested by TSS is read from the standard input
with UNIX typing conventions.

An interrupt signal (ASCII DEL)
is transmitted
as a "break" to TSS.

Input lines beginning with !_ are interpreted as UNIX
commands.
Input lines beginning with ~_ are interpreted as commands
to the interface routine.
.sp
~<file	insert input from named UNIX file
.sp
~>file	deliver tss output to named UNIX file
.sp
~p	pop the output file
.sp
~q	disconnect from tss (quit)
.sp
~r file	receive from HIS routine CSR/DACCOPY
.sp
~s file	send file to HIS routine CSR/DACCOPY
.sp
Ascii files may be most efficiently transmitted using
the HIS routine CSR/DACCOPY
in this fashion.
Underlined text comes from TSS.
AFTname is the 6070 file to be dealt with.
