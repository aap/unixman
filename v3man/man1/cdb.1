SYNOPSIS	cdb___ [ core [ a.out ] ]
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	cdb___
is a debugging program for use with C programs.
It is by no means completed,
and this section is essentially only a placeholder
for the actual description.

Cdb resembles db__ in many respects, except that
all integers are decimal.

Even the present cdb___ has one useful feature:
the command 

	$

will give a stack
trace
of the core image of a terminated C program.
The calls are listed in the order made;
the actual arguments to each routine are given
in octal.
