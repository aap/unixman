SYNOPSIS
.br
fe__d_
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION
.br
fed___ is used to edit a form letter associative memory
file, form.m, which consists of named strings.
Commands consist of single letters followed by a list of
string names separated by a single space and ending with a
new line.
The conventions of the Shell with respect to '*' and '?' hold for
all commands but m_ where literal string names are expected.
The commands are:

.in +5
.ti -5
e name918 ...

e_dit writes the string whose name is name918 onto a temporary file
and executes the system editor ed__.  On exit from the system
editor the temporary file is copied back into the associative
memory.  Each argument is operated on separately.  The sequence of
commands to add the string from 'file' to memory with name
'newname' is as follows:

	e newname
	0	(printed by ed)
	r file
	200
	w
	200
	q	(get out of ed)
	q	(get out of fe)

To dump a string onto a file:

	e name
	200	(printed by ed)
	w filename
	200
	q	(get out of ed)
	q	(get out of fe)

d [ name918 ... ]

d_eletes a string and its name from the memory.  When called with
no arguments d_ operates in a verbose mode typing each string
name and deleting only if a 'y' is typed.  A 'q' response returns
to fed's command level.  Any other response does nothing.
.sp 2
.ti -5
m name918 name928 ...

(m_ove) changes the name of name918 to name928 and removes previous
string name928 if one exists.  Several pairs of arguments may be given.
.sp 2
.ti -5
n [ name918 ... ]

(n_ames) lists the string names in the memory.  If called with
the optional arguments, it just lists those requested.
.sp 2
.ti -5
p name918 ...

p_rints the contents of the strings with names given by the arguments.

q
(q_uit) returns to the system.

.ti -5
c [ p_ ] [ f_ ]

c_hecks the associative memory file for consistency
and reports the number of free headers and blocks.
The optional arguments do the following:
.sp
.in +5
.ti -2
p causes any unaccounted for string to be 
printed

.ti -2
f fixes broken memories by adding 
unaccounted-for headers to free
storage and removing references to
released headers from associative
memory.

WARNING		It
is legal but an unwise idea to have string names
with blanks, ":" or "?" in them.
