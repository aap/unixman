SYNOPSIS	opr___ [--__] [-_] [+_] [+-__]file918 ...

DESCRIPTION	opr___
will arrange to have the
201 data phone daemon submit a job to the
Honeywell 6070 to print the file arguments.
Normally,
the output appears at the GCOS central site.
If the first argument is --__, the output
is remoted to station R1.
(Station R1 has a 1403 printer.)

Normally, each file is printed in the state it is found
when the data phone daemon reads it.
If a particular file argument is preceded by +_,
or a preceding argument of +_ has been encountered,
then opr___ will make a copy for the daemon to print.
If the file argument is preceded by -_,
or a preceding argument of -_ has been encountered,
then opr will unlink (remove) the file.

If there are no
arguments except for the optional --__,
then the standard input is read and off-line printed.
Thus opr___ may be used as a filter.
