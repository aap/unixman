SYNOPSIS	vs__
.sp
.ti0
DESCRIPTION	vs__
accepts phoneme descriptor lists and translates them into
byte strings suitable for the Federal Screw Works Voice
Synthesizer.
Phoneme descritors should be separated by commas and
have the general form "%NIxx"
where "xx" is a one or two character phoneme name,
"I" is an optional inflection parameter,
and "%N" is an optional count of the number of times
the phoneme is to be repeated (maximum 9).
"I" can have the values 0, 1, 2, 3 representing decreasing
strength (default is 2).
A description of the phonemes and their names can be
found in the file vsp___(VII).
For example,
.in +5
.sp
a0,o1,t,r,1ai,1ay,d,j,ih,u1,%2s
.sp
.in-5
will generate the word "outrageous".
The output is buffered;
a newline will cause the buffered output to be
sent to the Voice Synthesizer.
