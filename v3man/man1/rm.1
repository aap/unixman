NAME		rm  -- remove (unlink) files

SYNOPSIS	rm__ [ -f__ ] [ -r__ ] name\d1\u ...
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	rm__
removes the entries for one or more files from a directory.
If an entry was the last link to the file, the file
is destroyed.
Removal of a file requires write permission in its directory,
but neither read nor write permission on the file itself.

If there is no write permission to a
file designated to be removed,
rm__ will print the file name, its mode and then
read a line from the standard input.
If the line begins with 'y', the file is removed,
otherwise it is not.
The optional argument -f__ prevents the above interaction.

If a designated file is a directory,
an error comment is printed unless the optional
argument -r__ has been used.
In that case, rm__ recursively deletes the
entire contents of the specified directory.
To remove directories per se see rmdir(I).
