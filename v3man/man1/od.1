.ti -2

.in -5
The file argument specifies which file is to be dumped.
If no file argument is specified,
the standard input is used.
Thus od can be used as a filter.

The offset argument specifies the offset
in the file where dumping is to commence.
This argument is normally interpreted
as octal bytes.
If '.' is appended, the offset is interpreted in
decimal.
If 'b' is appended, the offset is interpreted in blocks.
(A block is 512 bytes.)
If the file argument is omitted,
the offset argument must be preceded by '+'.

Dumping continues until an end-of-file
condition or until
halted by sending an interrupt signal.
