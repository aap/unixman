DESCRIPTION	The
line printer special file is
the UNIX interface to a DEC LP-11 line printer.
This file may only be opened (or creat'ed) for writing.
Anything written on this file is printed on the line printer.
The following special cases for the
printer are handled:
.sp
.in +3
On opening and on closing, the paper is
slewed to the top of the next page.
.sp
For the 64 character printer (LP11-FA),
all lower case letters are
converted to upper case.
.sp
Tabs are converted to align on every eighth column.
.sp
New lines and form feeds are ignored when the
printer is at the top of a page.
This is done so that pr__ and roff____ output may
be directed to the printer and sync on
page boundaries even with automatic page slew.
.sp
Carriage return and back space
can cause multiple printing on a single line
to allow for overstruck graphics.
