SYNOPSIS	bc__ [ -c__ ] sfile\d1\u.b__ ... ofile\d1\u ...

DESCRIPTION	bc__
is the UNIX B interpreter.
It accepts three types of arguments:

Arguments whose names end with ".b" are assumed to be
B source programs; they are compiled, and
the object program is left on the file sfile\d1\u.o (i.e.
the file whose name is that of the source with ".o" substituted
for ".b").

Other arguments (except for "-c") are assumed
to be either loader flag arguments, or B-compatible
object programs, typically produced by an earlier bc__ run,
or perhaps libraries of B-compatible routines.
These programs, together with the results of any
compilations specified, are loaded (in the order
given) to produce an executable program with name
a.out_____.

The "-c" argument suppresses the loading phase, as does
any syntax error in any of the routines being compiled.
.sp
The language itself is described in [1].
.sp
The future of B is uncertain.
The language has been totally eclipsed by the
newer, more powerful, more compact, and faster
language C.
