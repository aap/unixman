DESCRIPTION

.in 8
bj__
is a serious attempt at
simulating the dealer
in the game of black jack (or twenty-one)
as might be found in Reno.
The following rules apply:
.sp
.in +3
The bet is $2 every hand.
.sp
A player 'natural' (black jack) pays $3.
A dealer natural loses $2.
Both dealer and player naturals
is a 'push' (no money exchange).
.sp
If the dealer has an ace up,
the player is allowed to make an 'insurance'
bet against the chance of a dealer natural.
If this bet is not taken, play resumes as normal.
If the bet is taken, it is a side bet
where the player wins $2 if the dealer has
a natural and loses $1 if the dealer does not.
.sp
If the player is dealt two cards
of the same value, he is allowed to
'double'.
He is allowed to play two
hands, each with one of these cards.
(The bet is doubled also; $2 on each hand.)
.sp
If a dealt hand
has a total of ten or eleven,
the player may 'double down'.
He may double the bet ($2 to $4)
and receive exactly one more card on that hand.
.sp
Under normal play,
the player may 'hit' (draw a card)
as long as his total is not over twenty-one.
If the player 'busts' (goes over twenty-one),
the dealer wins the bet.
.sp
When the player 'stands' (decides not to hit),
the dealer hits until he attains
a total of seventeen or more.
If the dealer busts, the player wins the bet.
.sp
If both player and dealer stand,
the one with the largest total wins.
A tie is a push.
.sp
.in -3
The machine deals and keeps score.
The following questions will be asked at
appropriate times.
Each question is
answered by y_ followed by a new line for 'yes',
or just new line for 'no'.
.sp

.sp
Every time the deck is shuffled,
the dealer so states and the 'action' (total bet)
and 'standing' (total won or loss)
is printed.
To exit, hit the interrupt key (DEL)
and the action and standing will be printed.
