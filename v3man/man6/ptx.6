SYNOPSIS	ptx___ input output
.sp

DESCRIPTION	ptx___
generates a permuted index from file input_____ on file output______.
It has three phases: the first does the permutation, generating
one line for each keyword in an input line.  The
keyword is rotated to the front.
The permuted file is then
sorted.
Finally the sorted lines are rotated so the keyword
comes at the middle of the page.

input_____ should be edited to remove useless lines.
The following words are suppressed:  "a", "and", "as",
"is", "for", "of", "on", "or", "the", "to", "up".

The index for this manual was generated using ptx___.
