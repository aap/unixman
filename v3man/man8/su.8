SYNOPSIS	su__

DESCRIPTION	su
allows one to become the super-user, who has
all sorts of marvelous (and correspondingly dangerous) powers.
In order for su to do its magic, the user must
supply a password.
If the password is correct, su
will execute the shell with the UID set to
that of the super-user.
To restore normal UID privileges,
type an end-of-file to the super-user shell.

To remind the super-user of his responsibilities,
the shell substitutes "#" for its usual prompt "%".
