SYNOPSIS	mov $key,r0
.br
jsr pc,crypt

DESCRIPTION	On entry, r0 should point to a string of
characters terminated by an ASCII NULL.  The routine
performs an operation on the key which is difficult to invert
(i.e. encrypts it) and leaves the resulting eight bytes
of ASCII alphanumerics in a global cell called "word".
.sp
Login uses this result as a password.
