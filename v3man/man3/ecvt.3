DESCRIPTION	Ecvt
is called with a floating point number in fr0.
.sp
On exit, the number has been converted into a
string of ascii digits in a buffer pointed to by r0.
The number of digits produced is controlled
by a global variable "_ndigits".

Moreover, the position of the decimal point is
contained in r2: r2=0 means the d.p. is at the
left hand end of the string of digits;
r2>0 means the d.p. is within or to the right
of the string.

The sign of the number is indicated by r1 (0 for +; 1 for -).

The low order digit has suffered decimal rounding
(i. e. may have been carried into).
.sp
Fcvt is identical to ecvt, except that the correct digit
has had decimal rounding for F-style output of the number
of digits specified by "_ndigits".
