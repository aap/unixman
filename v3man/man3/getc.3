DESCRIPTION	These routines are used to provide a buffered input
facility.
iobuf_____ is the address of a 518(10) byte buffer area whose
contents are maintained by these routines.  Its format is:
.sp
.nf
ioptr:	.=.+2		/ file descriptor
	.=.+2		/ characters left in buffer
	.=.+2		/ ptr to next character
	.=.+512.	/ the buffer
.sp
.fi
fopen_____ may be called initially to open the file.  On return,
the error bit (c-bit) is set if the open failed.
If fopen_____ is never called, get___ will read from the standard
input file.
.sp
getc____ returns the next byte from the file in r0.  The
error bit is set on end of file or a read error.
.sp
getw____ returns the next word in r0.  getc____ and getw____
may be used alternately; there are no odd/even
problems.
.sp
iobuf_____ must be provided by the user; it must be on a word boundary.

To reuse the same buffer for another file, it is sufficient
to close the original file and call fopen_____ again.
