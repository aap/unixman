DESCRIPTION	qsort_____
is an implementation
of the quicker sort algorithm.
It is designed to sort equal length
elements.
Registers r1 and r2 delimit the region of
core containing the array of byte strings to be sorted:
r1 points to the start of the first string, r2 to the first
location above the last string.
Register r3 contains the length of each string.
r2-r1 should be a multiple of r3.
On return, r0, r1, r2, r3, r4 are destroyed.

The routine compar (q.v.) is called to compare elements
and may be replaced by the user.
