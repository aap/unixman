DESCRIPTION	mt?___
is the DEC TU10/TM11 magtape.
When opened for reading or writing,
the magtape is rewound.
A tape consists of a
series of 512 byte records terminated by an
end-of-file.
Reading less than 512 bytes
causes the rest of a record to be ignored.
Writing less than a record causes
null padding to 512 bytes.
When the magtape is closed
after writing,
an end-of-file is written.
.sp
Seek has no effect on the magtape.
The magtape can only be opened once at
any instant.

BUGS		Seek
should work on the magtape.
Also, a provision of having the tape open for
reading and writing should exist.
A multi-file and multi-reel facility should
be incorporated.
