.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd speak
[
.bd \*-epsv
] [ vocabulary 
[
output ]

.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Speak
turns a stream of words
into utterances and outputs them to a voice synthesizer,
or to the specified output file.
It has facilities for maintaining a vocabulary.
It receives, from the standard input 
.s3
.lp +5 3
\*-	working lines: text of words separated by blanks
.lp +5 3
\*-	phonetic lines: strings of phonemes for one word preceded
and separated by commas.
The phonemes may be followed by comma-percent then a `replacement
part' \*- an ASCII string with no spaces.
The phonetic code is given in bs (VII).
.lp +5 3
\*-	empty lines
.lp +5 3
\*-	command lines: beginning with
.bd !.
The following command lines
are recognized:
.s3
.lp +15 10
\fB!r\fR file	replace coded vocabulary from file
.lp +15 10
\fB!w\fR file	write coded vocabulary on file
.lp +15 10
\fB!p\fR	print phonetics for working word
.lp +15 10
\fB!l\fR	list vocabulary on standard output with phonetics
.lp +15 10
\fB!c\fR word	copy phonetics from working word to
specified word
.lp +15 10
\fB!d\fR	print decomposition into substrings
.lp +15 10
.s3
.i0
Each working line replaces its predecessor.
Its first word is the `working word'.
Each phonetic line replaces the phonetics stored for the
working word.
In particular, a phonetic line of comma only deletes the
entry for the working word.
Each working line, phonetic line or empty line
causes the working line to be uttered.
The process terminates at the end of input.
.s3
Unknown words are pronounced by rules, and failing that,
are spelled.
Spelling is done by taking each character of
the word, prefixing it with `*', and looking it up.
Unspellable words burp.
.s3
.it Speak
is initialized with a coded vocabulary stored in file
.it /usr/lib/speak.m.
The vocabulary option substitutes a different file for
.it /usr/lib/speak.m.
.s3
A set of single letter options may
appear in any order preceded by
.bd \*-.
Their meanings are:
.s3
.lp +8 4
\fB\*-e\fR	suppress English preprocessing
.lp +8 4
\fB\*-p\fR	suppress pronunciation by rule
.lp +8 4
\fB\*-s\fR	suppress spelling
.lp +8 4
\fB\*-v\fR	suppress voice output
.s3
.i0
The following input will reconstitute a
coded vocabulary, `speak.m', from an ascii listing, `speak.v', that
was created using \fB!l\fR.
`Null' names a nonexistent vocabulary file.
.s3
.lp +8 0
cat speak.v \*- \*v speak \*-v null

!w speak.m

.br
vs (VII), vs (IV)
.sh BUGS
Excessively long words cause dumps.
.br
Space is not reclaimed from changed entries;
use \fB!w\fR and \fB!r\fR to effect reclamation.
.br
The first phoneme is sometimes dropped
when \fB!p\fR is used after \fB!d\fR.
