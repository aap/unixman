.sh NAME
apl \*- APL interpreter
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd apl
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Apl
is an interpreter for the language APL
described in the reference.
The interpreter maintains its workspace
on disk rather than in core.
This has two consequences:
there is the potential of a million byte workspace;
it takes a week to access that much data.
