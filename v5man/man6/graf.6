.th GRAF VI 5/1/74
.sh NAME
graf \*- draw graph on GSI terminal
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd "graf | nroff | gsi"
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Graf
is a preprocessor to
.it nroff
(q.v.) for producing plots imbedded in documents.
The standard input is copied to the standard output
except for plots,
which are inserted whenever a line beginning ``.GR'' is found.
The remainder of the line should be the arguments to
.it plog,
normally including a ``<file'' to point off
to the data for the graph.
.it Graf
itself reads its standard input.

.it Graf
and
.it neqn
can be used together:

neqn files | graf | nroff | gsi

produces a memo with figures and equations and text all intermixed.
There is no typesetter equivalent of
.it graf,
nor are there any plans for one.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
plog (VI), neqn (I), nroff (I), gsi (VI)
.sh BUGS
Same as
.it plog
(VI).
Axes and labels are not scaled down correctly for smaller graphs.
It should recognize .so commands.
