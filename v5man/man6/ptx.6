.sh NAME
ptx \*-  permuted index
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd ptx
[
.bd \*-t
]
input [ output ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Ptx
generates a permuted index from file 
.it input
on file
.it output.
It has three phases: the first does the permutation, generating
one line for each keyword in an input line.
The keyword is rotated to the front.
The permuted file is then
sorted.
Finally the sorted lines are rotated so the keyword
comes at the middle of the page.
.s3
.it Input
should be edited to remove useless lines.
The following words are suppressed:  `a', `an', `and', `as',
`is', `for', `of', `on', `or', `the', `to', `up'.
.s3
The optional argument
.bd \*-t
causes
.it ptx
to prepare its output for the
phototypesetter.
.s3
The index for this manual was generated using
.it ptx.
