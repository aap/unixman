by a numerical argument:
it specifies the height desired for the plot.
.br
.lp +2 2
-	There is a new option `w' similar to `h',
except that the width is specified.

.sh BUGS
Same as plot (VI). Drawing lines is not yet done exactly right.
If you store the output in a file,
before printing with cat you must turn off delays
and turn off CR-NL echo (e.g. ``stty -delay nl'');
