.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Tmg
produces a translator for the language whose parsing
and translation rules are described in file name.t.
The new translator appears
in a.out and may be used thus:
.s3
.bd a.out
input [ output ]
.s3
Except in rare cases input must be a randomly
addressable file.
If no output file is specified, the standard output file
is assumed.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Syntactic errors result in "???" followed by the
offending line.

Situations such as space overflow
with which the Tmg processor or a Tmg-produced
processor can not cope result in a descriptive comment and 
a dump.
