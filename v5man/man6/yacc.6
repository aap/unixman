.th YACC I 6/6/73
.sh NAME
yacc \*- yet another compiler-compiler
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd yacc
[
.bd \*-v
]
[ grammar ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Yacc
converts a context-free grammar into a set of
tables for a simple automaton which executes an LR(1) parsing
algorithm.
The grammar may be ambiguous;
specified precedence rules are used to break ambiguities.
.s3
The output is
.it y.tab.c,
which must be compiled by the C compiler
and loaded with any other routines
required (perhaps a lexical analyzer) and the Yacc library:
.s3
	cc y.tab.c other.o \*-ly
.s3
If the
.bd \*-v
flag is given, the file
.it y.output
is prepared, which contains a description of the parsing tables
and a report on
conflicts generated by ambiguities in the grammar.
