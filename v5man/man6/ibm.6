.sh NAME
ibm \*- submit off-line job to HO IBM 370
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd ibm
[
.bd \*-j
] file ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Ibm
arranges to have the 201 data phone daemon submit
a job to the IBM 370 at Holmdel via the Murray Hill H6070.
Normally the job is submitted with enough ``JCL''
(the IBM version of the shell)
to return the output to your box at Murray Hill.
You can supply your own if you dare\*-
the
.bd \*-j
option suppresses all JCL.
.s3
If there are no arguments,
the standard input is read and submitted.
Thus
.it ibm
may be used as a filter.

.sh BUGS
Stuff is sent on 6-bit cards,
so lower case vanishes,
as do some of the special characters.
