.sh NAME
ps \*- process status
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd ps
[
.bd aklx
]
[ namelist ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Ps
prints certain indicia about active
processes.
The
.bd a
flag asks for information about all processes with teletypes (ordinarily
only one's own processes are displayed);
.bd x
asks even about processes with no typewriter;
.bd l
asks for a long listing.
Ordinarily only the typewriter number (if not one's own),
the process number,
and an approximation to the command line are given.
If the
.bd k
flag is specified,
the special file
.it /usr/sys/core
is used in place of
.it /dev/mem.
This is used for
postmortem system debugging.
.s3
The long listing is columnar and contains
.s3
.lp +5 0
A number encoding the state (last digit)
and flags (first 1 or 2 digits) of the process.
.s3
The priority of the
process; high numbers mean low priority.
.s3
A number related in some unknown way to the
scheduling heuristic.
.s3
The last character of
the control typewriter of the process.
.s3
The process unique number
(as in certain cults it is possible
to kill a process if you know its true name).
.s3
The size in blocks of the core image of the process.
.s3
The last column if non-blank tells the core
address in the system of the
event which the process is waiting for;
if blank, the process is running.
.s3
.i0
.dt
.it Ps
makes an educated guess as to the file name
and arguments given when the process was created
by examining core memory or the swap area.
The method is inherently somewhat unreliable and in any event
a process is entitled to destroy this information,
so the names cannot be counted on too much.

.sh BUGS
The command has assumptions built into it
about the number of typewriters that exist
and what hardware is used to interface them.
It also has built into it the name of the device
used for swapping.
