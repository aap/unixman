.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Grep
will search the input files
(standard input default)
for each line containing the
regular expression.
Normally, each line found
is printed on the standard output.
If the
.bd \*-v
flag is used,
all lines but those matching
are printed.
If the
.bd \*-c
flag is used,
each line printed is preceded by its line number
If the
.bd \*-n
flag is used,
each line is preceded
by the name of the input file and
its relative line number in that file.
If the
.bd \*-b
flag is used,
each line is preceded by the block number
on which it was found.
This is sometimes useful in locating
disk block numbers by context.
If interrupt is hit,
the file and line number last searched is printed.

For a complete description
of the regular expression,
see ed (I).
Care should be taken when
using the characters
$ * [ ^ | ( ) and \\ in the regular
expression as they are
also meaningful to the Shell.
It is generally necessary to enclose the
entire
.it expression
argument in quotes.
