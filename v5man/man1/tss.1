.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd tss
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Tss
will call the Honeywell 6070 on
the 201 data phone.
It will then go into direct access with
MH-TSS.
Output generated by MH-TSS is typed on the standard output and
input requested by MH-TSS is read from the standard input
with UNIX typing conventions.
.s3
An interrupt signal
is transmitted
as a `break' to MH-TSS.
.s3
Input lines beginning with
`!'
are interpreted as UNIX
commands.
Input lines beginning with
`~'
are interpreted as commands
to the interface routine.
