.sh NAME
cdb \*- C debugger
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd cdb
[ core [ a.out ] ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Cdb
is a debugger for use with C programs.
The first argument is a core-image file;
if not given, ``core'' is used.
The second argument is the object
program (containing a symbol table);
if not given ``a.out'' is used.
An acceptable core and object file
must both be present.
.s3
Commands to
.it cdb
consist of an address,
followed by a single command character.
If no address is given the last-printed
address is used.
An address may be followed by a comma and
a number,
in which case the command applies
to the appropriate number of successive addresses.
.s3
Addresses are expressions composed of names,
decimal numbers, and octal numbers
(which begin with ``0'') and separated by
``+'' and ``\*-''.
Evaluation proceeds left-to-right.
The construction ``name[expression]''
assumes that
.it name
is a pointer to an integer
and is equivalent
to the contents of the named cell plus twice the expression.
.s3
The command characters are:
.s3
.lp +4 4
/	print the addressed words in octal.
.s3
.lp +4 4
=	print the value of the addressed expression.
.c2 @
.s3
.lp +4 4
\*a	print the addressed bytes as characters.
.c2 '
.s3
.lp +4 4
"	take the address as a pointer to a sequence
of characters, and print the characters up to a null byte.
.s3
.lp +4 4
&	If there is any symbol which has the same value
as the address, print the symbol's name.
.s3
.lp +4 4
$	print a stack trace of the terminated program.
The calls are listed in the order made;
the actual arguments to each routine are
given in octal.

.sh BUGS
It's still very feeble,
even compared with
.it "db (I)."
The stack trace is also pretty
vulnerable to corruption,
and often doesn't work.
