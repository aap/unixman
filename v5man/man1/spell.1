.th SPELL I 2/26/74
.sh NAME
spell \*- find spelling errors
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd spell
file ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Spell
attacks the same problem as
.it "typo (I),"
but from the opposite direction.
It extracts words from the input files and looks them up in
.it "Webster's Seventh Collegiate Dictionary;"
any words which appear neither in the dictionary
nor in a list of about 2000 words
frequently occuring in Bell Laboratories documents
are listed on the output file
.it sp.out.
Words which are reasonable transformations of dictionary entries
(e.g. a dictionary entry plus
.it s
)
are so marked;
words which could not be found even when transformed
are marked with asterisks.
.s3
The process takes on the order of 5 to 10 minutes.
There is a limit of nine input files.
.sh FILES
/usr/lib/w2006, /usr/dict/words, sp.out; spjnkq[123] are temporaries.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
typo (I)
.sh BUGS
.s3
There should be no limit on the number of input files.
.s3
More suffixes, and perhaps some prefixes, should be added.
.s3
It should be usable as a filter.
