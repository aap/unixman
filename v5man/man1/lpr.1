.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Lpr
arranges to have the line printer daemon print the file arguments.
.s3
Normally, each file is printed in the state it is found
when the line printer daemon reads it.
If a particular file argument is preceded by
.bd +,
or a preceding argument of
.bd +
has been encountered,
then
.it lpr
will make a copy for the daemon to print.
If the file argument is preceded by
.bd \*-,
or a preceding argument of
.bd \*-
has been encountered,
then
.it lpr
will unlink (remove) the file.
.s3
If there are no arguments,
then the standard input is read and on-line printed.
Thus
.it lpr
may be used as a filter.
