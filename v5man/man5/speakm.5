.sh DESCRIPTION
This type of file is created and used only by
.it speak.
The keys are the words,
word fragments and
letters of the vocabulary.
.s3
The \fIi\fRth key is stored as a null-terminated string at
.it &vocab.strings[entry[i].key].
Its phonetic string is similarly stored at
.it &vocab.strings[entry[i].phon].
The keys are ordered lexicographically.
The contents of certain parts of
.it vocab
are invariant:
.it "vocab.entry[0].key ="
.it "vocab.entry[0].phon ="
.it "vocab.strings[0] = 0."
.s3
Each key is maintained exactly as entered into
.it speak,
so that fragments are recognized by an initial `%'
and letters by an initial `*'.
.s3
Each phoneme of a phonetic string is maintained in
.it vs
code.
A `%' in a phonetic string is represented as octal 001,
and all following characters are kept literally.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
speak (VI), vs (VII)
.sh BUGS
The coding 001 for `%' precludes the use of phoneme
.it 3-1,
which is no particular loss on the model 5 Vortrax,
but will pinch on the model 6.
0200 would be a safe choice.
