.sh NAME
ttys \*- typewriter initialization data
.sh DESCRIPTION
The
.it ttys
file is read by the
.it init
program and specifies
which typewriter special files are to have
a process created for them which will allow people to
log in.
It consists of lines of 3 characters each.
.s3
The first character is either `0' or `1';
the former causes the line to be ignored,
the latter causes it to be effective.
The second character is the last character in the name
of a typewriter; e.g. \fIx\fR refers to
the file `/dev/tty\fIx\fR'.
The third character is the offset in a table
contained in
.it init
which selects an initialization program for the line;
currently it must be `0' and the only such program is
.it /etc/getty.
.sh FILES
found in /etc
