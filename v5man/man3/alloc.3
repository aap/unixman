.th ALLOC III 3/1/74
.sh NAME
alloc \*- core allocator
.sh SYNOPSIS
.ft B
.nf
char *alloc(size)
.s3
free(ptr)
char *ptr;
.fi
.ft R
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Alloc
and
.it free
provide a simple general-purpose core management package.
.it Alloc
is given a size in bytes; it returns a pointer
to an area at least that size which
is even and hence can hold an object of any type.
The argument to
.it free
is a pointer to an area previously allocated by
.it alloc;
this space is made available for further allocation.
.s3
Needless to say, grave disorder will result if the space
assigned by
.it alloc
is overrun or if some random number is handed to
.it free.
.s3
The routine uses a first-fit algorithm which
coalesces blocks being freed with other
blocks already free.
It calls
.it sbrk
(see
.it "break (II))"
to get more core from the system when there is no
suitable space already free,
and writes ``Out of space'' on the standard output,
then exists, if that fails.
.s3
The external variable
.it slop
(which is 2 if not set)
is a number such that if
.it n
bytes are requested,
and if the first free block of size at least
.it n
is no larger than
.it n+slop,
then the whole block will be allocated
instead of being split up.
Larger values of
.it slop
tend to reduce fragmentation at the
expense of unused space in the allocated blocks.
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
``Out of space'' if it needs core and can't get it.
