.sh NAME
reset \*- execute non-local goto
.sh SYNOPSIS
.ft B
setexit( )
.s3
reset( )
.ft R
.sh DESCRIPTION
These routines are useful
for dealing with errors
discovered in a low-level subroutine
of a program.
.s3
.it Setexit
is typically called just at the start of
the main loop of a processing program.
It stores certain parameters such as the call point and the stack
level.
.s3
.it Reset
is typically called after diagnosing an error
in some subprocedure called from the main loop.
When
.it reset
is called,
it pops the stack appropriately
and generates a non-local return from
the last call to
.it setexit.
.s3
It is erroneous, and generally
disastrous,
to call
.it reset
unless
.it setexit
has been called in a routine which is
an ancestor of
.it reset.
