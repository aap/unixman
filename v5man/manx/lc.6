.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Lc
is the UNIX LIL compiler.
It accepts three types of arguments:
.s3
Arguments whose names end with `.l'
are taken to be LIL source programs;
they are compiled,
and each object program is left on the file whose name
is that of the source with `.o' subsituted for `.l'.
The `.o' file is normally deleted,
however, if a single LIL program is compiled and loaded
all at one go.
.s3
The following flags are interpreted by
.it lc.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fB\*-c\fR	Suppress the loading
phase of the compilation,
and force an object file to be produced
even if only one program is compiled.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fB\*-p\fR	if loading takes place,
replace the standard startup routine by one
which automatically calls the
.it monitor
subroutine (III) at the start and arranges
to write out a
.it mon.out
file at normal termination of execution of the object program.
An execution profile can then be generated
by use of
.it prof
(I).
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fB\*-P\fR	Run only the string preprocessor
on the named LIL programs,
and leave the output on corresponding files
suffixed `.i'.
.dt
.i0
.s3
Other arguments are taken to be object programs
or perhaps libraries of routines.
These programs, together with the results
of any compilations specified,
are loaded (in the order given)
to produce an executable program with the name
.bd a.out.
