.sh DESCRIPTION
The currently executing process is set into
the priority specified by
.it priority.
If
.it priority
is positive,
the priority of the process is below default;
if negative the process must be the super-user
and its priority is raised.
The valid range of
.it priority
is 20 and \*-220.
The value of 16 is recommended to users
who wish to execute long-running programs
without flak from the administration.
.s3
The effect of this call is
passed to a child process by the

system call.
The effect can be cancelled by
another call to
.it nice
with a
.it priority
of 0.

(c-bit)

outside the range of 0 to 20
and is not the super-user.
