NAME		od  --  octal dump

.ti 0
SYNOPSIS	od__ name [ origin ]
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	od__
dumps a file in octal,
eight words per line
with the origin of the line on the left.
If an octal origin is given it is truncated to 0 mod 16
and dumping starts from there,
otherwise from 0.
Printing continues until an end-of-file condition
or until halted by sending an interrupt signal.
.sp
Since od__ does not seek,
but reads to the desired starting point,
od__ (rather than db__) should be used to dump special files.
