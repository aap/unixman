DESCRIPTION	su
allows one to become the super-user, who has
all sorts of marvelous powers.
In order for su to do its magic, the user must
pass as an argument a password.
If the password is correct, su
will execute the shell with the UID set to
that of the super-user.
To restore normal UID privileges,
type an end-of-file to the super-user shell.
