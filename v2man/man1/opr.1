SYNOPSIS	opr___ file918 ...

DESCRIPTION	opr___
will arrange to have the
201 data phone daemon submit a job to the
Honeywell 6070 to print the file arguments.
Normally, each file is printed in the state it is found
when the data phone daemon reads it.
If a particular file argument is preceded by +_
then opr___ will make a copy for the daemon to print.
If the file argument is preceded by -_
then opr will unlink the file.

BUGS		Since all but the
+_ option in opr___ is implemented with links_____,
one cannot use these options for files not in /usr____.
.sp
opr___ should recognize +_ and -_ alone
and apply them to all subsequent arguments.
