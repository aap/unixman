DESCRIPTION	mount_____
announces to the system that a removable file system has
been mounted on special file special_______;
from now on, references to file name____ will refer to
the root file on the newly mounted file system.
Special_______ and name____ are pointers to null-terminated strings
containing the appropriate path names.

Name____ must exist already.  If it had useful contents,
they are inaccessible while the file system
is mounted.

Almost always, name____ should be a directory
so that an entire file system, not just one file,
may exist on the removable device.
