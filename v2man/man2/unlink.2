SYNOPSIS	sys unlink; name  / unlink = 10.

DESCRIPTION	Name____
points to a null-terminated string.
Unlink______
removes the entry for the file pointed to by name____
from its directory.
If this entry was the last link to the file,
the contents of the file are freed and the file is destroyed.
If, however, the file was open in any process, the actual
destruction is delayed until it is closed, even though
the directory entry has disappeared.

DIAGNOSTICS	The error bit
(c-bit) is set to indicate that the file does not
exist or that its directory cannot be written.
Write permission is not required on the file itself.
It is also illegal to unlink a directory
(except for the super-user).

BUGS		Probably write permission
should be required to remove the last link to a file,
but this gets in other problems
(namely, one can donate an undeletable file to someone else).
.sp
If the system crashes while a file is waiting to
be deleted because it is open, the space is lost.
