NAME		wait  --  wait for process to die
.sp
.ti 0
SYNOPSIS	sys wait  / wait = 7.
.br
(process ID in r0)
.br
(termination status/user status in MQ)
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	wait____
causes its caller to delay until one of its child
processes terminates.
If any child has already died, return is immediate;
if there are no children, return is immediate with
the error bit set.
In the case of several children several wait____s are needed
to learn of all the deaths.
.sp
If the error bit is not set on return,
the MQ high byte contains the low byte of the
child process r0 when it terminated.
The MQ low byte contains the termination status
of the process from the following list:
.sp
   0	exit
   1	bus error
   2	trace trap
   3	illegal instruction
   4	IOT trap
   5	power fail trap
   6	EMT trap
   7	bad system call
   8	quit
   9	interrupt
   10 	kill (see kill(II))
   +16	core image produced

BUGS		A child
which dies but is never
waited for is not really gone
in that it still consumes disk swap
and system table space.
This can make it impossible to create new processes.
The bug can be noticed when several "&" separators
are given to the shell not followed by a command without
an ampersand.
Ordinarily things clean themselves up when
an ordinary command is typed,
but is possible to get into a situation in which
no commands are accepted,
so no wait____s are done;
the system is then hung.
.sp
The fix, probably, is to have a new kind of fork____
which creates a process for which no
wait____ is necessary (or possible);
also to limit the number of active or inactive
descendants allowed to a process.
