PREFACE
to the Second Edition


In the months since this manual first appeared,
many changes have occurred
both in the system itself and in the way it is
used.

Perhaps most obviously,
there have been additions, deletions, and modifications
to the system and its software.
It is these changes, of course, that
caused the appearance of this revised manual.

Second, the number of people spending
an appreciable amount
of time writing UNIX software has increased.
Credit is due
to L.|L.|Cherry, M.|D.|McIlroy, L.|E.|McMahon, R.|Morris,
and J.|F.|Ossanna
for their contributions.

Finally, the number of UNIX installations
has grown to 10, with more expected.
None of these has exactly the same complement
of hardware or software.
Therefore, at any particular installation,
it is quite possible that this manual will
give inappropriate information.
One area to watch concerns commands which
deal with sepcial files (I/O devices).
Another is places which talk about such things
as absolute core locations which are likely
to vary with the memory configuration
and existence of protection hardware.
Also, not all installations have the latest versions
of all the software.
In particular, the assembler and loader
have just undergone major reorganization
in anticipation of a UNIX for the PDP-11/45.

INTRODUCTION


This manual gives descriptions of the publicly available
features of UNIX.
It provides neither a general
overview (see "The UNIX Time-sharing System" for that)
nor details of the implementation of the system (which
remain to be disclosed).

Within the area it surveys, this manual attempts
to be as complete and timely as possible.
A conscious
decision was made to describe each program
in exactly the state it was in at the time
its manual section
was prepared.
In particular, the
desire to describe something as it should be, not as it is,
was resisted.
Inevitably, this means that
many sections will soon be out of date.
(The rate of
change of the system is so great that a dismayingly
large number of early sections
had to be modified while the rest were being written.
The unbounded effort required to stay up-to-date
is best indicated by the fact that several of the programs
described were written specifically to aid in preparation
of this manual!)

This manual is divided into
seven sections:

   I.   Commands
   II.  System calls
   III. Subroutines
   IV.  Special files
   V.   File formats
   VI.  User-maintained programs
   VII. Miscellaneous

Commands are programs intended to be invoked directly by
the user, in contradistinction to subroutines, which are
intended to be called by the user's programs.
Commands generally reside in directory /bin____ (for
bin___ary programs).  This directory is searched automatically
by the command line interpreter.  Some programs
classified as commands are located elsewhere; this
fact is indicated in the appropriate sections.

System calls are entries into the UNIX supervisor.
In assembly language, they are coded with the use
of the opcode "sys", a synonym for the
trap____ instruction.

A small assortment
of subroutines is available;
they are described in section III.
The binary form of most of them is kept in
the system library /usr/lib/liba.a.

The special files section IV discusses the characteristics of
each system "file" which actually refers to an I/O device.

The file formats section V documents the structure of particular
kinds of files; for example, the form of the output of the loader and
assembler is given.  Excluded are files used by only one command,
for example the assembler's intermediate files.

User-maintained programs (section VI) are not considered part
of the UNIX system, and the principal reason for
listing them is to indicate their existence without
necessarily giving a complete description.
The author should be consulted for information.

The miscellaneous section (VII) gathers odds and ends.


Each section consists of a number of independent
entries of a page or so each.
The name of the entry is in the upper right corner of its pages,
its preparation date in the upper left.
Entries within each section are
alphabetized.
It was thought better to avoid running page numbers,
since it is hoped that the manual will be updated frequently.
Therefore each entry is numbered starting at page 1.

All entries have a common format.

The name____ section repeats the entry name and gives
a very short description of its purpose.

The synopsis________ summarizes the use of the
program being described.
A few conventions are used, particularly in the
Commands section:

.in 8
Underlined words are considered literals, and
are typed just as they appear.

Square brackets ([]) around an argument
indicate that the argument is optional.
When an argument is given as "name", it always
refers to a file name.

Ellipses "..." are used to show that the previous argument-prototype
may be repeated.

A final convention is used by the commands themselves.
An argument beginning with a minus sign "-"
is often taken to mean some sort of flag argument
even if it appears in a position where a file name
could appear.  Therefore, it is unwise to have files
whose names begin with "-".

The description___________ section discusses in detail the subject at hand.

The files_____ section gives the names of files which are
built into the program.

A see___ also____ section gives pointers to related information.

A diagnostics___________
section discusses
the diagnostics that may be produced.
This section tends to be as terse
as the diagnostics themselves.

The bugs____ section gives
known bugs and sometimes deficiencies.
Occasionally also the suggested fix is
described.

The owner_____ section gives the name of the person
or persons to be consulted in case of difficulty.
The rule has been that the last one to modify something
owns it, so the owner is not necessarily the author.
The owner's nicknames stand for:

   ken    K. Thompson
   dmr    D. M. Ritchie
   jfo    J. F. Ossanna
   rhm    R. Morris
   doug   M. D. McIlroy
   lem    L. E. McMahon
   llc    L. L. Cherry
   csr    C. S. Roberts

These nicknames also happen to be UNIX user ID's,
so messages may be transmitted by the mail____ command or,
if the addressee is logged in, by write_____.

At the beginning of this document is a table of contents,
organized by section and alphabetically within each section.
There is also a permuted index derived from the table of contents.
Within each index entry, the title
of the writeup to which
it refers is followed by the appropriate section number in parentheses.
This fact is important because there is considerable
name duplication among the sections,
arising principally from commands which
exist only to exercise a particular system call.


This manual was prepared using the UNIX text
editor ed__ and the formatting program roff____.
