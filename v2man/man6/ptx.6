DESCRIPTION	ptx___
generates a permuted index from file input_____ on file output______.
It has three phases: the first does the permutation, generating
one line for each keyword in an input line.  The
keyword is rotated to the front.
The permuted file must then be
sorted.
ptx2____ then rotates each line around the middle
of the page.

input_____ should be edited to remove useless lines.
The following words are suppressed:  "a", "and", "as",
"is", "for", "of", "on", "or", "the", "to", "up".

The index for this manual was generated using ptx___.
