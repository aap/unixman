DESCRIPTION	mt0___
is the DEC TU10/TM11 magtape.
When opened for reading or writing,
the magtape is rewound.
A tape consists of a
series of 256 word records terminated by an
end-of-file.
Reading less than 256 words (512 bytes)
causes the rest of a record to be ignored.
Writing less than a record causes
null padding to 512 bytes.
When the magtape is closed
after writing,
an end-of-file is written.
.sp
Seek has no effect on the magtape.
The magtape can only be opened once at
any instant.
