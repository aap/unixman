SYNOPSIS	--
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	These files refer to
DECtape drives 0 to 7.
Since the logical drive number can be manually set,
all eight files exist even though at present there are fewer
physical drives.

The 256-word blocks on a standard DECtape are numbered 0 to 577.
However, the system makes no assumption about this number;
a block can be read or written if it exists on the
tape and not otherwise.
An error is returned if a transaction
is attempted for a block which does not exist.

Like the RK and RF special files,
addressing on the tape files is block-oriented.
See the RF0 section.
