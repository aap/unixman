NAME		tm  --  provide time information
.sp
.ti 0
SYNOPSIS	tm__ [ command arg\d1\u .... ]
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	tm__
is used to provide timing information.
When used without an argument, output like the following
is given:
.sp
.in +5
   tim  77:43:20       29.2
   ovh  13:59:42       	1.2
   dsk  12:06:30        4.1
   idl 352:31:37       23.7
   usr   3:32:15        0.1
   der    5, 171     0,   0
.sp
.in -5
The first column of numbers gives totals in the named categories
since the last time the system was cold-booted;  the second
column gives the changes since the last time tm__ was invoked.
The tim___ row is total real time
(hours:minutes:seconds);
unlike the other times, its origin is the creation date of
tm__'s temporary file.
ovh___ is time spent
executing in the system;
dsk___ is time spent waiting for
both kinds of disk I/O; idl___ is idle time; usr___ is user execution
time; der___ is RF disk error count (left number) and RK disk error
count (right number).
.sp
tm__ can be invoked with arguments which are assumed
to constitute a command to be timed.
In this case the output is as follows:
.sp
.in +5
 tim        2.2
 ovh        0.3
 swp        0.5
 dsk        1.8
 idl        0.0
 usr        0.0
.sp
.in -5
The given times represent the number of seconds spent
in each category during execution of the command.

.ti 0
FILES		/tmp/ttmp,
/dev/rf0 (for absolute times)
contains the information used to calculate the differential times.
.sp
.ti 0
SEE ALSO	format of file system
(which tells where the times come from)
.sp
.ti 0
DIAGNOSTICS	"?" if the command cannot be executed;
"can't creat temp file" if trouble with ttmp____;
"cant read super-block" if times cannot be read from system.

BUGS		(1) when invoked with a command argument,
everything going on at the moment is counted,
not just the command itself.
(2) Two users doing tm__ simultaneously
interfere with each other's use of the temporary file.
