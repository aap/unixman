DESCRIPTION	type____
produces output on an IBM 2741 terminal with
a Correspondence type ball.
.sp
type____ uses typewriter tty5, which,
because of the lack of access ports,
is also used as a standard communication channel.
Therefore, who___ should be used to verify
the absence of a user on tty5.
.sp
The method is as follows:
type the type____ command.
It will wait until tty5 is dialled up.
When the phone answers, depress the interrupt button
after paper has been loaded, and the first file will be typed.
type____ spaces out to the end of a sheet of paper and
waits until the interrupt button is depressed before
beginning each new file.
