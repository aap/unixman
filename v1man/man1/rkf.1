DESCRIPTION	rkf___
formats a virgin disk pack.
Because it destroys all information on that pack,
and because it is not interlocked against file system activity
on the pack, the rkf___ program is not maintained
in executable form.
Instead the source must be located and assembled.

BUGS		As mentioned,
rkf___ is not interlocked against system I/O;
if I/O is already occurring, it will be badly disrupted.
In any event, all information on the pack is destroyed.
