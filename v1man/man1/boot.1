DESCRIPTION	boot____

BUGS		Should obviously not be executable
by the general user.
Also, it should reboot in a more direct manner.
The mechanism invoked by jumping to the
ROM loader is sensitive to the contents of the console switches,
which makes the whole procedure even more dangerous.
.sp
Rather than jumping to the ROM,
boot____ should simulate the ROM action with 173700
in the switches. In this manner,
It may be used when the switches are not set,
and even in installation without a ROM.
