DESCRIPTION	mkfs____
initializes either a DECtape (argument "t")
or an RK03 disk pack (argument "r")
so that it contains an empty file system.
mkfs____ or its equivalent must be used before
a tape or pack can be mounted as a file system.
.sp
In both cases the super-block, i-list, and free list
are initialized, and a root directory containing
entries for "." and ".." are created.
For RK03's the number of available blocks is 4872, for tapes 578.
.sp
This program is kept in /etc to avoid inadvertant use and
consequent destruction of information.
