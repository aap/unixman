NAME		form -- form letter generator

SYNOPSIS	form____ proto arg918 ...
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	form____
generates a form letter from a prototype
letter, an associative memory, arguments and in a special case, the
current date.
.sp
If form____ is invoked with the argument x_,
the following files come into play:
.sp
  x.f prototype input
  x.r form letter output
  x.am associative memory
  form.am associative memory if x.am not found.
.sp
Basically, form____ is a copy process from the file x.f to the file x.r.
If an element of the form \\n (where n_ is a digit from 1 to 9) is encountered,
the n_th argument is inserted in its place, and that argument is then
rescanned.  If \\0 is encountered, the current date is inserted.  If
the desired argument has not been given, a message of the form "\\n: " is
typed.  The response typed in then is used for that argument.
.sp
If an element of the form [name] is encountered, the name is looked up in the
associative memory.  If it is found, the contents of the memory under this
name replaces the original element (again rescanned).  If
the name is not found, a message of the form "name: " is typed.
The response typed in is used for that element.  If the associative memory is writable,
the response is entered in the memory under the name.
Thus the next search for that name will succeed without interaction.
.sp
In both of the above cases, the response is typed in by entering
arbitrary text terminated by two new lines.  Only the first of the
two new lines is passed with the text.
The process is instantly terminated if an end of file is encountered
anywhere except in the associative memory.
