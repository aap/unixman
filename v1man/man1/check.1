SYNOPSIS	check_____ [ filesystem [ blockno918 ... ] ]
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	check_____
will examine a file system,
build a bit map of used blocks,
and compare this bit map against
the bit map maintained on the file system.
If the file system is not specified,
a check of both /dev/rf0 and /dev/rk0
is performed.
Output includes the number of files on the file system,
the number of these that are 'large', the number
of used blocks, and the number of free blocks.

DIAGNOSTICS	Diagnostics are produced for
blocks missing, duplicated, and bad block addresses.
Diagnostics are also produced for block numbers passed as parameters.
In each case, the block number, i-number, and
block class (i_ = inode, x_ indirect, f_ free) is printed.

BUGS		The
checking process is two pass in nature.
If checking is done on an active file system,
extraneous diagnostics may occur.
.sp
The swap space on the RF file system is
not accounted for and will therefore show up as
`missing'.
