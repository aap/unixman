SYNOPSIS	--

DESCRIPTION	ppt___
refers to the paper tape reader or punch,
depending on whether it is read or written.

When ppt___ is opened for writing, a 100-character leader
is punched.
Thereafter each byte written is punched on
the tape.  No editing of the characters
is performed.
When the file is closed, a 100-character trailer is punched.

When ppt___ is opened for reading, the process
waits until tape is placed in the reader and the reader
is on-line.
Then requests to read cause the characters read
to be passed back to the program, again without
any editing.
This means that several null characters
will usually appear at the beginning of the file.
Likewise several nulls are likely to appear at the end.
End-of-file is generated when the tape runs out.

Seek calls for this file are meaningless
and are effectively ignored
(however, the read/write pointers are maintained
and an arbitrary sequence of reads or writes intermixed
with seeks will give apparently correct results
when checked with tell____).

BUGS		Previously,
there were separate special files for ASCII tape
(which caused null characters to be suppressed)
and binary tape
(which used a blocked format with checksums).
These notions were conceptually quite attractive,
but they were discarded to save space in the system.
