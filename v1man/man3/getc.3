SYNOPSIS	mov	$filename,r0
.br
jsr	r5,fopen; iobuf

jsr	r5,getc; iobuf
.br

.br
(word in r0)

DESCRIPTION	These routines are used to provide a buffered input
facility.
iobuf_____ is the address of a 134(10) byte buffer area whose
contents are maintained by these routines.  Its format is:
.sp
.nf
ioptr:	.=.+2		/ file descriptor
	.=.+2		/ characters left in buffer
	.=.+2		/ ptr to next character
	.=.+128.	/ the buffer
.sp
.fi
fopen_____ should be called initially to open the file.  On return,
the error bit (c-bit) is set if the open failed.
If fopen_____ is never called, get___ will read from the standard
input file.
.sp
getc____ returns the next byte from the file in r0.  The
error bit is set on end of file or a read error.
.sp
getw____ returns the next word in r0.  getc____ and getw____
may be used alternately; there are no odd/even
problems.
.sp
iobuf_____ must be provided by the user; it must be on a word boundary.

DIAGNOSTICS	c-bit set on EOF or error

BUGS		for greater speed,
the buffer should be 512 bytes long.
Unfortunately, this will cause several existing programs
to stop working.
