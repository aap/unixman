SYNOPSIS	sys	cemt; arg  / cemt = 29.; not in assembler
.fi
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	This call
allows one to catch traps resulting from
the emt___ instruction.
Arg___ is a location within the program; emt___ traps
are sent to that location.
The normal effect of emt___ traps may be restored by giving
an arg___ equal to 0.
.sp
Prior to the use of this call,
the result of an emt___ instruction
is a simulated rts___ instruction.
The operand field is interpreted as a register,
and an rts___ instruction is simulated for that register
(after verifying that various register have appropriate values).
This feature is useful for debugging, since the most
dangerous program bugs usually involve an rts___
with bad data on the stack or in a register.
