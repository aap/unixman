DESCRIPTION	stty____
sets mode bits for a typewriter whose file descriptor
is passed in r0.
First, the system delays until the typewriter is quiescent.
Then, the argument dcrsr_____ is placed into the typewriter's
receiver control and status register,
and dcpsr_____ is placed in the printer control and status register.
The DC-11 manual must be consulted for the format of these
words.
For the purpose of this call, the most important ro^le of
these arguments is to adjust to the speed of the typewriter.
.sp
The mode____ argument contains several bits which determine the
system's treatment of the typewriter:
.sp
.in +3
.nf
200  even (M37 tty) parity allowed
100  odd (non-M37 tty) allowed
040  raw mode: wake up on all characters
020  map CR into LF; echo LF or CR as CR-LF
010  don't echo (half duplex)
004  map upper case to lower on input (M33 TTY)
.fi
.in -3
.sp
.fi
Characters with the wrong parity, as determined by bits 200 and
100, are ignored.
.sp
In raw mode, every character is passed back immediately
to the program.  No erase or kill processing is done;
the end-of-file character (EOT), the interrupt character
(DELETE) and the quit character (FS) are not treated specially.
.sp
Mode 020 causes input carriage returns to be turned into
new-lines;
input of either CR or LF causes CR-LF both to
be echoed
(used for GE TermiNet 300's).
