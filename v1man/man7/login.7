SYNOPSIS	--

DESCRIPTION	UNIX
must be called from an appropriate terminal.
The two general classes of
terminals which UNIX supports are typified by
the 37 Teletype on the one hand and
the GE TermiNet 300 and Memorex 1240 on the other.
The principal difference is the baud rate (150 vs. 300)
and the treatment of the carriage return character.
Most terminals operating at 150, 300, or 1200 baud
using the ASCII character set either work (more or less)
at the moment or can be used by special arragement.
In particular, special arrangement is necessary for terminals
which do not generate lower-case ASCII characters

It is also necessary to have
a valid UNIX user ID and (if desired) password.  These
may be obtained, together with the telephone number, from the system administrators.

The same telephone number
serves terminals operating at both the standard speeds.
When a connection is established via a 150-baud terminal
(e.g. TTY 37) UNIX types out "login:"; you respond with
your user name, and, if a mask is typed, with a password.
If the login was successful, the "@" character
is typed by the Shell to indicate
login is complete and commands may be issued.
A message of the day may be typed if there are any announcements.
Also, if there is a file called "mailbox", you are notified
that someone has sent you mail.
(See the mail____ command.)

From a 300-baud terminal, the procedure is slightly different.
Such terminals often have a full-duplex switch, which should
be turned on (or conversely, half-duplex should be turned off).
When a connection with UNIX is established, a few garbage
characters are typed (these are the "login:" message at the wrong speed).
You should depress the "break" key;
this is a speed-independent signal to UNIX that a 300-baud
terminal is in use.  It will type "login:" (at the correct speed
this time) and from then on the procedure is the same as described
above.

Logging out is simple by comparison (in fact, sometimes too simple).
Simply generate an end-of-file at Shell level by using
the EOT character; the "login:" message will appear again to
indicate that you may log in again.

It is also possible to log out simply by hanging up the terminal;
this simulates an end-of-file on the typewriter.

BUGS		Hanging up
on programs which never read
the typewriter or which ignore end-of-files
is very dangerous; in the worst cases,
the programs can only be halted by restarting the system.
