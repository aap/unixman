SYNOPSIS	dcheck______ [ -l__ ] [ device ]
.sp
.ti 0
DESCRIPTION	dcheck______
builds an image of the directory hierarchy
of the specified device
by reading all its directories (using physical I/O
guided by the i-nodes on the device).
A list entry is made for
each file encountered.
A second pass reads the i-nodes and for
each file compares the number of links
specified in its i-node
with the number of entries actually seen.
All discrepancies are noted.
.sp
If no device is specified,
a default device is assumed.
.sp
The argument -l__ causes a complete
listing of the file names on the device
in i-node order.
