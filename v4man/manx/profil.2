SYNOPSIS	profil = 44.		/ not in assembler

sys	profil; buff; bufsiz; offset; scale

DESCRIPTION	buff____
points to an area of core whose length (in bytes) is given by
bufsiz______.
After this call, the user's program counter (pc)
is examined each clock tick (60th second);
offset______ is subtracted from it, and the result multiplied by
scale_____.
If the resulting number corresponds to a word
inside buff____, that word is incremented.
.s3
The scale is interpreted as an unsigned,
fixed-point fraction with binary point at the
left: 177777(8) gives a 1-1 mapping of pc's to words
in buff____; 77777(8) maps each pair of instruction words
together.
2(8) maps all instructions onto the beginning of
buff____ (producing a non-interrupting core clock).
.s3
Profiling is turned off by giving a scale_____ of 0 or 1.
It is rendered
inffective by giving a bufsiz______ of 0.

BUGS		Profiling must be turned off before
an exec____(II), since incrementation of
the buffer is not automatically stopped.
