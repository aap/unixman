DESCRIPTION	stty____
sets mode bits for a typewriter whose file descriptor
is passed in r0 (resp. is the first argument to the call).
First, the system delays until the typewriter is quiescent.
Then, the argument dcrsr_____ (first word in arg___) is placed into the typewriter's
receiver control and status register,
and dctsr_____ (second word in arg___) is placed in the transmitter control and status register.
The DC-11 manual must be consulted for the format of these
words.
For the purpose of this call, the most important ro^le of
these arguments is to adjust to the speed of the typewriter.
It is reasonable, however, to
use the values of these words as they
are supplied by gtty____
if the mode argument only is to be changed.
.sp
The mode____ argument (third word in arg___) contains several bits which determine the
system's treatment of the typewriter:
.sp
.in +3
.nf
200  even parity allowed on input (e. g. for M37s)
100  odd parity allowed on input
040  raw mode: wake up on all characters
020  map CR into LF; echo LF or CR as LF-CR
010  echo (full duplex)
004  map upper case to lower on input (e. g. M33)
002  echo and print tabs as spaces
001  inhibit all function delays (e. g. CRTs)
.fi
.in -3
.sp
.fi
Characters with the wrong parity, as determined by bits 200 and
100, are ignored.
.sp
In raw mode, every character is passed back immediately
to the program.  No erase or kill processing is done;
the end-of-file character (EOT), the interrupt character
(DELETE) and the quit character (FS) are not treated specially.
.sp
Mode 020 causes input carriage returns to be turned into
new-lines;
input of either CR or LF causes LF-CR both to
be echoed
(used for GE TermiNet 300's and other terminals without the newline function).
.sp
Additional bits in the high order byte of the mode argument
are used to indicate that the terminal is an IBM|2741
and to specify 2741 modes.
These mode bits are:
.sp
.in+8
.ll+6
.ti-6
|400  terminal is an IBM|2741
.ti-6
1000  the 2741 has the transmit interrupt feature (currently ignored)
.ti-6
2000  use correspondence code conversion on output
.ti-6
4000  use correspondence code conversion on input (currently ignored)
.sp
.in -8
.ll-6
Normal input and output code conversion
for 2741s is EBCDIC (e. g. 963 ball and corresponding keyboard).
The presence of the transmit interrupt feature permits
the system to do read-ahead while no output is in progress.
In 2741 mode, the low order bits 331 are ignored.

DIAGNOSTICS	The error bit
(c-bit) is set if the file descriptor does not refer to a typewriter.
From C, a negative value indicates an error.

BUGS		This call should be used with care.
