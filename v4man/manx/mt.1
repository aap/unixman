.sh NAME
mt  \*-  manipulate magtape
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd mt
[ key ] [ name ... ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it mt
saves and restores selected portions of the file system
hierarchy on magtape.
Its actions are controlled by the
.it key
argument.
The key is a string of characters containing
at most one function letter and possibly
one or more function modifiers.
Other arguments to the command are file or directory
names specifying which files are to be dumped, restored,
or tabled.
.s3
The function portion of
the key is specified by one of the following letters:
.s3
.lp +3 3
\fBr\fR	The indicated files and directories, together with
all subdirectories, are dumped
onto the tape.
The old contents of the tape are lost.
If no arguments are given,
.bd r
is the default.
.s3
.lp +3 3
\fBx\fR	extracts the named files from the tape to the file system.
The owner, mode, and date-modified are restored to what they
were when the file was dumped.
If no file argument is given, the entire contents of the
tape are extracted.
.s3
.lp +3 3
\fBt\fR	lists the names of all files stored on the tape which
are the same as or are hierarchically below
the file arguments.  If no file argument is given,
the entire contents of the tape are tabled.
.s3
.lp +3 3
\fBl\fR	is the same as
.bd t
except that an expanded listing
is produced giving all the available information about the
listed files.
.s3
.i0
The following characters may be used in addition to the letter
which selects the function desired.
.s3
.lp +8 8
\fB0,|...,|7\fR	This modifier selects the drive on which the tape is mounted.
.bd 0
is the default.
.s3
.lp +8 8
\fBv\fR	Normally
.it mt
does its work silently.  The
.bd v
(verbose)
option causes it to type the name of each file it treats
preceded by a letter to indicate what is happening:
.bd a
indicates a file is being added;
.bd x
indicates a file is being extracted.
The
.bd v
option can be used with
.bd r
and
.bd x
only.
.s3
.lp +8 8
\fBf\fR	causes
new entries copied on tape to be `fake' in that
only the entries, not the data associated
with the entries are updated.
Such fake entries cannot be extracted.
Usable only with
.bd r.
.s3
.lp +8 8
\fBw\fR	causes
.it mt
to pause before treating each file, type
the indicative letter and the file name (as with
.bd v)
and await the user's response.  Response
.bd y
means `yes', so the file is treated.  Null response
means `no', and the file does not take part
in whatever is being done.  Response
.bd x
means `exit';
the
.it mt
command terminates immediately.  In the
.bd x
function,
files previously asked about
have been extracted already.
With
.bd r,
no change has been made to the tape.

.sh FILES
/dev/mt?
.sh "SEE ALSO"
tap(I), tap(V)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Several; the only non-obvious one is:
.br
`Phase error'\*- a file has changed after it was selected for
dumping but before it was dumped.
.br
.sh BUGS
It doesn't save the mode correctly, so files are restored
mode 666.
If, during an
.bd x,
the files are specified in a different order
than they are on the tape,
seek errors will result because the command believes
the tape
cannot be rewound.
