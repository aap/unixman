.th CRYPT I 10/23/71
.sh NAME
crypt \*- encode/decode
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd crypt
[ password ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it crypt
is an exact implementation of Boris Hagelin's
cryptographic machine called the M-209 by the U. S. Army [1].
.s3
.it crypt
reads from the standard input file and writes
on the standard output.
It is thus suitable for use as a filter.
For a given password, the encryption
process is idempotent;
that is,
.s3
.bd "	crypt znorkle <clear >cypher"
.br
.bd "	crypt znorkle <cypher"
.s3
will print the clear.
