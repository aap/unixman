.sh NAME
tap  \*-  manipulate DECtape
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd tap
[ key ] [ name ... ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it tap
saves and restores selected portions of the file system
hierarchy on DECtape.
Its actions are controlled by the
.it key
argument.
The key is a string of characters containing
at most one function letter and possibly
one or more function modifiers.
Other arguments to the command are file or directory
names specifying which files are to be dumped, restored,
or tabled.
.s3
The function portion of
the key is specified by one of the following letters:
.s3
.lp +8 4
\fBr\fR	The indicated files and directories, together with
all subdirectories, are dumped
onto the tape.
If files with the same names
already exist, they are replaced.
`Same' is determined by string comparison, so
`./abc' can never be the same as `/usr/dmr/abc' even
if `/usr/dmr' is the current directory.
If no file argument is given, `\fB.\fR' is the default.
.s3
.lp +8 4
\fBc\fR	updates the tape.
.bd u
is the same as
.bd r,
but a file is replaced only if its
modification date is later than the date stored on the tape;
that is to say, if it has changed since it was dumped.
.bd u
is the default command if none is given.
.s3
.lp +8 4
\fBd	\fRdeletes the named files and directories from
the tape.  At least one file argument must be given.
.s3
.lp +8 4
\fBx\fR	extracts the named files from the tape to the file system.
The owner, mode, and date-modified are restored to what they
were when the file was dumped.
If no file argument is given, the entire contents of the
tape are extracted.
.s3
.lp +8 4
\fBt\fR	lists the names of all files stored on the tape which
are the same as or are hierarchically below
the file arguments.  If no file argument is given,
the entire contents of the tape are tabled.
.s3
.lp +8 4
\fBl\fR	is the same as
.bd t
except that an expanded listing
is produced giving all the available information about the
listed files.
.s3
.i0
The following characters may be used in addition to the letter
which selects the function desired.
.s3
.lp +10 6
\fB0,...,7\fR	This
modifier selects the drive on which the tape is mounted.
`0' is the default.
.s3
.lp +10 6
\fBv\fR	Normally
.it tap
does its work silently.  The
.bd v
(verbose)
option causes it to type the name of each file it treats
preceded by a letter to indicate what is happening.
.s3
.lp +13 3
\fBr\fR	file is being replaced
.lp +13 3
\fBa\fR	file is being added (not there before)
.lp +13 3
\fBx\fR	file is being extracted
.lp +13 3
\fBd\fR	file is being deleted
.s3
.lp +10 6
	The
.bd v
option can be used with
.bd "r, u, d,"
and
.bd x
only.
.s3
.lp +10 6
\fBc\fR	means a fresh dump is being created; the tape directory
will be zeroed before beginning.  Usable only with
.bd r
and
.bd u.
.s3
.lp +10 6
\fBf\fR	causes new entries on tape to be `fake' in that
no data is present for these entries.
Such fake entries cannot be extracted.
Usable only with
.bd r
and
.bd u.
.s3
.lp +10 6
\fBw\fR	causes
.it tap
to pause before treating each file, type
the indicative letter and the file name (as with v)
and await the user's response.  Response
.bd y
means `yes', so the file is treated.  Null response
means `no', and the file does not take part
in whatever is being done.  Response
.bd x
means `exit';
the
.it tap
command terminates immediately.  In the
.bd x
function,
files previously asked about
have been extracted already.
With
.bd "r, u,"
and
.bd d
no change has been made to the tape.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Several; the non-obvious one is
`Phase error', which means the file changed after it was selected for
dumping but before it was dumped.
.sh BUGS
Asks
about fake entries on \fBxw\fR, when it should ignore
them.
If a fake entry is extracted, and the file already
exists on disk, the extraction does not take
place (as is correct), but the mode and user ID of the file
are set to 0.
