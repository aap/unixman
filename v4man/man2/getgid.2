.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Getgid
returns
the real group ID of
the current process.
The real group ID identifies the group of the person who is logged in,
in contradistinction to the effective group ID, which
determines his access permission at the moment.
It is thus useful to programs which operate using
the ``set group ID'' mode, to find out who invoked them.
