.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Stty
sets mode bits and character speeds for the typewriter whose file descriptor
is passed in r0 (resp. is the first argument to the call).
First, the system delays until the typewriter is quiescent.
Then the speed and general handling of the
input side of the typewriter is set from
the low byte of the first word of the
.it arg,
and the speed of the output side is set from the
high byte of the first word of the
.it arg.
The speeds are selected from the following table.
This table corresponds to the
speeds supported by the DH-11 interface.
The starred entries are those speeds actually supported
by the DC-11 interfaces actually present;
if a non-starred speed is selected, it will be ignored and
the present speed left unchanged.

.i0
In the current configuration,
only 150 and 300 baud are really supported,
in that the code conversion and line control required for
2741's (134.5 baud)
must be implemented by the user's
program,
and the half-duplex line discipline
required for the 202 dataset (1200 baud)
is not supplied.
.s3
The
second word of the
.it arg
is currently unused and is available for expansion.
.s3
The third word of the
.it arg
sets the
.it mode.
It
contains several bits which determine the
system's treatment of the typewriter:
.s3
.lp +12 5
10000	no delays after tabs (e.g. TN 300)
.lp +12 5
200	even parity allowed on input (e. g. for M37s)
.lp +12 5
100	odd parity allowed on input
.lp +12 5
040	raw mode: wake up on all characters
.lp +12 5
020	map CR into LF; echo LF or CR as CR-LF
.lp +12 5
010	echo (full duplex)
.lp +12 5
004	map upper case to lower on input (e. g. M33)
.lp +12 5
002	echo and print tabs as spaces
.lp +12 5
001	inhibit all function delays (e. g. CRTs)
.i0
.s3
Characters with the wrong parity, as determined by bits 200 and
100, are ignored.
.s3
In raw mode, every character is passed back immediately
to the program.  No erase or kill processing is done;
the end-of-file character (EOT), the interrupt character
(DELETE) and the quit character (FS) are not treated specially.
.s3
Mode 020 causes input carriage returns to be turned into
new-lines;
input of either CR or LF causes LF-CR both to
be echoed
(used for GE TermiNet 300's and other terminals without the newline function).

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
The error bit
(c-bit) is set if the file descriptor does not refer to a typewriter.
From C, a negative value indicates an error.
