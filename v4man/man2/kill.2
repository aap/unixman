.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Kill
sends the signal
.it sig
to the process specified by the
process number in r0.
See signal(II) for a list of signals.
.s3
The sending and receiving processes must
have the same controlling typewriter, otherwise
this call is restricted to the super-user.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
signal(II), kill(I)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
The error bit (c-bit)
is set if the process does not
have the same controlling typewriter and the
user is not super-user, or if the process
does not exist.
.sh BUGS
Equality between the controlling
typewriters of the sending and receiving process
is neither a necessary nor sufficient
condition for allowing the sending of a signal.
The correct condition is equality of user IDs.
