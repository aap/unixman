.sh DESCRIPTION
The file
whose name is given by the null-terminated string pointed
to by
.it name
has its owner changed to
.it owner
(a numerical user ID).
Only the present owner of a file (or the super-user) may
donate the file to another user.
Changing the owner of a file
removes the set-user-ID
protection bit
unless it is done by the super user or
the real user ID is the new owner.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
The error bit (c-bit) is set
on illegal owner changes.
From C a \*-1 returned value indicates error,
0 indicates success.
