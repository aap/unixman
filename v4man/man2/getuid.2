.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Getuid
returns
the real user ID of
the current process.
The real user ID identifies the person who is logged in,
in contradistinction to the effective user ID, which
determines his access permission at the moment.
It is thus useful to programs which operate using
the ``set user ID'' mode, to find out who invoked them.
