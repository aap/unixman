.sh NAME
msh \*- mini-shell
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd /etc/msh
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Msh
is a heavily simplified version of the Shell.
It reads one line from the standard
input file, interprets it as a command, and calls the command.
.s3
The mini-shell supports few of the advanced features
of the Shell; none of the following characters is special:
.s3
     >  <  $  \\  ;  &   \*v  ^
.s3
However, ``*'', ``['', and ``?'' are recognized and \fIglob\fR is called.
The main use of \fImsh\fR is to provide a command-executing
facility for various interactive sub-systems.
