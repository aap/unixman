.th RELOC VIII 2/7/73
.sh NAME
reloc \*- relocate object files
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd reloc
file octal [
.bd \*-
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Reloc
modifies the named object program file so that it will operate correctly
at a different core origin than the one for which
it was assembled or loaded.
.s3
The new core origin is the old origin
increased by
the given
.it octal
number (or decreased if the number has a `\*-' sign).
.s3
If the object file was generated by
.it ld,
the
.bd \*-r
and
.bd \*-d
options must have been given to
preserve the relocation information and define any common symbols
in the file.
.s3
If the optional last argument is given, then any
.it setd
instruction at the start of the file
will be replaced by a no-op.
.s3
The purpose of this command is to simplify the
preparation of object programs for systems
which have no relocation hardware.
It is hard to imagine a situation
in which it would be useful to attempt directly to execute
a program treated by
.it reloc.
