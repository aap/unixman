.sh NAME
update \*- periodically update the super block
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd update
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Update
is a program that executes
the
.it sync
primitive every 30 seconds.
This insures that the file system
is fairly up to date in case of a crash.
This command should not be executed directly,
but should be executed out of the
initialization shell command file.
See sync(II) for details.

sync(II), init(VII)
.sh BUGS
There is a system bug which, it is suspected,
may be aggravated by this program.
Until further notice,
.it update
should not be run.
