.sh NAME
kl \*- KL-11/TTY-33 console typewriter
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Tty
(as distinct from
.it tty?
)
refers to the console
typewriter hard-wired to the PDP-11 via a KL-11 interface.
The disciplines involved in dealing with
.it tty
are identical to those for
.it tty?
and section DC(I)
should be consulted.
The following differences are salient:
.s3
The system calls
.it stty
and
.it gtty
apply, and the bits in the mode word have
the same meanings,
but the speed-select word is ignored.
The quit signal is generated
by the key marked `alt mode.'
.s3
By appropriate
console switch settings, it is possible to cause
UNIX to
come up as a single-user system
with I/O on this device.
