.sh NAME
pfe \*- print floating exception
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd pfe
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Pfe
will examine the floating point exception register and
print a diagnostic for the last
floating point exception.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
signal(II)
.sh BUGS
Since there is but one floating point
exception register and it cannot be
saved and restored by the system,
the floating exception
that is printed is the one that occured system wide.
Floating exceptions are therefore volatile.
