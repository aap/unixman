.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Opr
will arrange to have the
201 data phone daemon submit a job to the
Honeywell 6070 to print the file arguments.
Normally,
the output appears at the GCOS central site.
If the first argument is
.bd \*-\*-,
the output
is remoted to station R1,
which has an IBM 1403 printer.
.s3
Normally, each file is printed in the state it is found
when the data phone daemon reads it.
If a particular file argument is preceded by
.bd +,
or a preceding argument of
.bd +
has been encountered,
then
.it opr
will make a copy for the daemon to print.
If the file argument is preceded by
.bd \*-,
or a preceding argument of
.bd \*-
has been encountered,
then
.it opr
will unlink (remove) the file.
.s3
If there are no
arguments except for the optional
.bd \*-\*-,
then the standard input is read and off-line printed.
Thus
.it opr
may be used as a filter.
