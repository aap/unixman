.sh NAME
ps \*- process status
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd ps
[
.bd alx
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Ps
prints certain indicia about active
processes.
The
.bd a
flag asks for information about all processes with teletypes (ordinarily
only one's own processes are displayed);
.bd x
asks even about processes with no typewriter;
.bd l
asks for a long listing.
Ordinarily only the typewriter number (if not one's own)
and the process number are given.
.s3
The long listing is columnar and contains
.s3
.lp +5 0
A number encoding the state (last digit)
and flags (first 1 or 2 digits) of the process.
.s3
The priority of the
process; high numbers mean low priority.
.s3
A number related in some unknown way to the
scheduling heuristic.
.s3
The last character of
the control typewriter of the process.
.s3
The process unique number
(as in certain cults it is possible
to kill a process if you know its true name).
.s3
The size in blocks of the core image of the process.
.s3
The last column if non-blank tells the core
address in the system of the
event which the process is waiting for;
if blank, the process is running.
.s3
.i0
.dt
Unfortunately if you have forgotten the number of a process
you will have to guess which one it is.
Plain
.it ps
will tell you only a list of numbers.

.sh BUGS
The ability to see, even if dimly,
the name by which the process was invoked would
be welcome.
