.sh NAME
sort \*- sort a file
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd sort
[
.bd \*-anr
] [ \fB+\fIn\fR ] [ \fB\*-\fIn\fR ] [ input [ output ] ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Sort
sorts
.it input
and writes the result on
.it output.
If the output file is not given,
the standard output is used.
If the input file is missing,
the standard input is used.
Thus
.it sort
may be used as a filter.
The input and output file may be the same.
.s3
The sort is line-by-line in increasing ASCII collating sequence,
except that upper-case letters are considered
the same as the corresponding lower-case letters.
.s3
.it Sort
understands several flag arguments.
.s3
.lp +4 4
\fB\*-a\fR	Use strict ASCII collating sequence.
.s3
.lp +4 4
\fB\*-n\fR	An initial numeric string is sorted by numerical value.
.s3
.lp +4 4
\fB\*-r\fR	Output is in reverse order.
.s3
.lp +4 4
\fB\*-\fIn\fR	The first \fIn\fR fields in each line
are ignored.  A field is defined as a string of non-space, non-tab
characters separated by tabs and spaces from its neighbors.
.s3
.lp +4 4
\fB+\fIn\fR	The first \fIn\fR characters are ignored
in the sort.
Fields (with \fB\*-\fIn\fR)
are skipped before characters.
