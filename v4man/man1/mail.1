.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Mail
without an argument searches for a file called
.it mailbox,
prints
it if present, and asks if it should be saved.  If the answer
is
.bd y,
the mail is renamed
.it mbox,
otherwise it is deleted.
.it Mail
with a
.bd \*-y
or
.bd \*-n
argument works the same way, except
that the answer to the question is supplied by the argument.
.s3
When followed by the names of a letter
and one or more people,
the letter is appended to
each person's
.it mailbox.
When a
.it person
is specified without a
.it letter,
the letter is taken from the sender's standard input up to an EOT.
Each letter is preceded by the sender's name and a postmark.
.s3
A
.it person
is either
a user name recognized by
.bd login,
in which case the mail
is sent to the default working directory of that user,
or the path name of a directory,
in which case
.it mailbox
in that directory is used.
.s3
When a user logs in he is informed of the presence
of mail.

.sh BUGS
