split \*- split a file into pieces
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd split
[ file1 [ file2 ] ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Split
reads file1 and writes
it in 1000-line pieces, as many as are necessary, onto
a set of output files.  The name of the first output
file is file2 with an `a' appended, and so on
through the alphabet and beyond.  If no output name is given,
`x' is default.
.s3
If no input file is given, or the first argument is `\*-',
then the standard input file is used.
.sh BUGS
Watch out for 14-character file names.
The number of lines per file should be
an argument.
