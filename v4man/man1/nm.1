.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Nm
prints the symbol table from the output file of an
assembler or loader run.
Each symbol name is preceded by its value (blanks if undefined)
and one of the letters \fBU\fR (undefined) \fBA\fR (absolute) \fBT\fR
(text segment symbol),
\fBD\fR (data segment symbol), \fBB\fR
(bss segment symbol),
or \fBC\fR (common symbol).
Global symbols have their first character underlined.
Normally, the output is sorted alphabetically
and symbols consisting of a letter followed by one
or more digits are not printed (that is,
symbols which look like C internal symbols).
