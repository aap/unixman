.th TYPE I 6/12/72
.sh NAME
type \*- type on 2741
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd type
file ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Type
copies its input files
to the fixed output port
.bd ttyc
converting to 2741 EBCDIC output code.
Before each new page (66 lines) and before each new file,
.it type
stops and reads the 2741
before continuing.
This allows time for insertion of single
sheet paper.
To continue,
push the ATTN key on the 2741.
.sh FILES
/dev/ttyc
.sh BUGS
Since it is impossible to
second guess a 2741,
quite often it is necessary to
print a # to put this device
in a state it might already be in.
.br
The value of padding out a page with up to 66
carriage returns is doubtful.
