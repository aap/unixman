.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd pr
[
.bd \*-h
name ] [ \fB\*-\fIn\fR ] [ \fB+\fIn\fR ] [ file ... ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Pr
produces a printed listing of one or more files.
The output is separated into pages headed by a date,
the name of the file or a header (if any), and the page number.
If there are no file arguments,
.it pr
prints the standard
input file, and is thus usable as a filter.
.s3
Options apply to all following files but may be reset
between files:
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fB\*-\fIn\fR	produce \fIn\fR-column output
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fB+\fIn\fR	begin printing with page \fIn\fR.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fB\*-h\fR	treat the next argument as a header
.s3
.i0
If there is a header in force, it is printed in place of
the file name.
Interconsole messages via write(I) are
forbidden during a
.it pr.
.sh FILES
/dev/tty?
to suspend messages.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
cat(I), cp(I)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
none (files not found are ignored)
.sh BUGS
It would be nice to be able to set the number of
lines per page.
