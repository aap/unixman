.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Comm
reads
.it file1
and
.it file2,
which should be in sort,
and produces a three column output: lines only in
.it file1;
lines only in
.it file2;
and lines in both files.
.s3
If
.it file3
is given, the output will be placed there;
otherwise it will be written on the standard output.
.s3
Flags 1, 2, or 3 suppress printing of the corresponding
column.
Thus
.bd comm
.bd \*-12
prints only the lines common to the two files;
.bd comm
.bd \*-23
prints only lines in the first file but not in the second;
.bd comm
.bd \*-123
is a no-op.
