.th WAIT I 4/9/73
.sh NAME
wait \*- await completion of process
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd wait
.sh DESCRIPTION
Wait until all processes started with
.bd &
have completed,
and report on abnormal terminations.
.s3
Because
.it "sys wait"
must be executed in the parent process,
the shell itself executes
.it wait,
without creating a new process
.sh "SEE ALSO"
sh(I)
.sh BUGS
After executing
.it wait
there is no way to interrupt
the processes waited on.
This is because interrupts were
set to be ignored when the process
was created.
The only out (if the process does not terminate)
is to
.it kill
the process from another terminal or to
hangup.
