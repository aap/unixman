.th KILL I 8/18/73
.sh NAME
kill \*- do in an unwanted process
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd kill
processid ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
Kills the specified processes.
The processid of each asynchronous process
started with `&' is reported by the shell.
Processid's can also be found by using \fIps\fR (I).
.s3
The killed process must have
been started from the same typewriter
as the current user, unless
he is the superuser.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
ps(I), sh(I)
.sh BUGS
Clearly people should only be allowed to kill
processes owned by them, and having the same typewriter
is neither necessary nor sufficient.
