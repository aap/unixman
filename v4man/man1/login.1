.th LOGIN I 3/15/72
.sh NAME
login  \*-  sign onto UNIX
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd login
[ username ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
The
.it login
command
is used when a user initially
signs onto UNIX, or it may be used at any time to change
from one user to another.
The latter case is the one summarized above and
described here.
See `How to Get Started' for how to dial up initially.
.s3
If
.it login
is invoked without an argument,
it will ask for a user name, and, if
appropriate, a password.
Echoing is turned off (if possible) during the typing of the password,
so it will not appear on the written record of the
session.
.s3
After a successful login,
accounting files are updated and
the user is informed of the
existence of
.it mailbox
and message-of-the-day files.
.s3
Login is recognized by the Shell
and executed directly (without forking).

`login incorrect,'

.sh BUGS
If the first login is unsuccessful,
it tends to go into a state where it won't accept
a correct login.
Hit EOT and try again.
