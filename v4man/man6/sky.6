.th SKY VI 9/22/73
.sh NAME
sky \*- obtain ephemerides
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd sky
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Sky
predicts the apparent locations
of the Sun, the Moon, the planets out to Saturn,
stars of magnitude at least 2.5,
and certain other celestial objects
including comet Kohoutek and M31.
.it Sky
reads the standard input to obtain
a GMT time typed
on one line with blanks separating
year, month number, day, hour, and minute;
if the year is missing the current year is used.
If a blank line is typed the current time is used.
The program prints the
azimuth, elevation, and magnitude
of objects which are above the horizon
at the ephemeris location of Murray Hill
at the indicated time.
.s3
Placing a ``1'' input after the minute entry
causes the program to print out the Greenwich Sidereal
Time at the indicated moment and
to print for each body
its right ascension and
declination as well as its azimuth and elevation.
Also, instead of the magnitude,
the geocentric distance of the body, in units the program
considers convenient, is printed.
(For planets the unit is essentially A. U.)
.s3
The magnitudes of Solar System bodies are not calculated
and are given as 0.
The effects of atmospheric extinction
are not included;
the mean magnitudes
of variable stars are marked with ``*''.
.s3
For all bodies, the program takes into account
precession and nutation of the equinox,
annual (but not diurnal) aberration, diurnal
parallax,
and the proper motion of stars (but not annual parallax).
In no case is refraction included.
.s3
The program takes into account perturbations
of the Earth due to the Moon, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.
The expected accuracies
are:
for the Sun and other stellar bodies
a few tenths of seconds of arc;
for the Moon (on which particular care is lavished)
likewise a few tenths of seconds.
For the Sun, Moon and stars the accuracy is sufficient
to predict the circumstances of eclipses and occultations
to within a few seconds of time.
The planets may be off by several minutes of arc.

may be obtained from its author.
